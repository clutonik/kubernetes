# Kubernetes

Kubernetes is a platform for managing containers through a layer of abstraction called 'pods'.
This repository holds the basic commands to work with a kubernetes cluster. It can also be used
as a cheat sheet for kubernetes.

## Minimum Requirements

- [ ] Install minikube. `brew install minikube`
  - This will install minikube and the kubectl binary.
- [ ] Start minikube. `minikube start --vm-driver=virtualbox`
  - This will start a local kubernetes cluster with 1 node using a hypervisor of your choice. `virtualbox` in my case.

## Basic Commands
